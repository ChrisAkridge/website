# Archive of KYOSS meetings materials

Presentations from the KYOSS monthly meetings.

* [2022](2022)
  * KYOSS met regularly, even during the COVID times of 2020 and 2021,
    but didn't keep any records of presentations during this time.
    Interest was re-kindled at the June 2022 meeting of keeping
    records of our meetings.
* [2019](2019)
  * Although KYOSS has been meeting regularly for many years, we only
    briefly experimented with keeping records of the presentations in
    the meetings in 2019.
